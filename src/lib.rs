//! Beap exposes mechanisms for [reserving](reserve) and [unreserving](unreserve) large amounts of
//! memory without contributing to the process' committed memory limit and for dynamically [committing](commit)
//! and [uncommitting](uncommit) those regions without affecting their readability through raw pointers.
//!
//! ## Terminology
//!
//! A given region in memory can be reserved, committed, or backed.
//!
//! - A **reserved** region of memory is a region which is guaranteed not to be allocated by any other
//!   system allocation mechanism. These do not contribute to the operating system's overcommit
//!   protections but may or may not be readable and writable by the process.
//!
//! - A **committed** region of memory may or may not be backed by actual memory. However, the
//!   operating system asserts that, upon first access to the data, the memory will be infallibly
//!   backed by some memory. To provide this guarantee, committed memory counts towards your process'
//!   commit charge countâ€”a virtual representation of how much physical memory the computer could
//!   eventually allocate to a given process.
//!
//! - A **backed** region of memory is backed by RAM or a page file and is thus taking "real" hardware
//!   resources. Although committed regions aren't backed by hardware resources, they are typically
//!   thought as owning some virtual representation of that same resource nonetheless so, for the
//!   purposes of this library, committed and backed memory regions are equivalent.
//!
//! Regions are described at page-level granularity, whose size varies between operating systems. This
//! value can be queried at runtime through [`page_size`].
//!
//! ## Support
//!
//! Beap is not guaranteed to be supported on all platforms so its support should be checked using the
//! [`is_supported`] macro.
//!
//! Currently, the following backends exist:
//!
//! - Unix (`#[cfg(unix)]`), which includes Linux, MacOS, and other POSIX.1-2001-compliant systems.
//!   Although commit charge behavior is not standardized, the behavior relied upon ("`PROT_READ` +
//!   `MAP_ANONYMOUS` + `MAP_PRIVATE` doesn't use any commit charges") is documented in Linux's
//!   [developer documentation](linux-overcommit) and seems to be present on MacOS as well.
//!
//! - Windows (`#[cfg(windows)]`), which includes Windows versions greater than *Windows 10* (client)
//!   and *Windows Server 2016* (server). TODO: Document necessary privileges and slow syscall performance.
//!
//! Additionally, this system is likely only useful for 64 bit systems where the virtual address
//! space is far larger than the actual amount of memory the operating system can give to a process
//! but this recommendation is not enforced by conditional compilation.
//!

//  privileges or a sufficiently high windows version. We may also want a feature to disable the
